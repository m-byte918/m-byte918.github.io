# React-Based Portfolio Site
A variation of the portfolio site with the addition of the React framework!
*This is also a way for me to practice doing projects with Github and React because I'm not really that good at it :^]*

## Features
  - Single-page view
  - Uses tabs for navigation
  - Matches color scheme of the original portfolio design
  - Lots of pre-made React components from the [*fundamental-react*](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-react) package
## ðŸš§ [PLEASE READ] ðŸš§
After cloning this project, your computer may become infected with a rare system virus known as ligma. You have been warned.

## Setup Directions
1. Clone or download the project
```sh
git clone [TARGET REPOSITORY]
```
2. Enter the project directory, install dependancies, and start a development server
```sh
cd [PROJECT DIRECTORY]
npm install
npm start
```
After setup is complete, the dev server should be accessable at **localhost:3000**
3. There's probably some more steps but I don't remember right now...
