            <p>
                My name is Christian Rodriguez and I am a 20-year-old freelance game developer. I work on open source
                projects and indie games in my free time. Ever since I was young, I have been obsessed with how computers
                work. I would take apart any computer I could get my hands on just to see how everything ran under the
                hood, and after my curiosity was satisfied, I would then learn about what software it was running. This
                interest continued to grow until it expanded to the world of video games. I eventually took a liking to
                programming, and I have studied with several programming languages since.
            </p>
            <p>
                My dream is to eventually graduate from being a freelance game developer to a full-time one. Besides
                programming and game development, I am also interested in astronomy, physics, and teaching what I know to
                others.

                I am currently a second-year student studying at the Pennsylvania College of Technology. I am pursuing a
                bachelor's degree in Game and Simulation Programming, and my studies focus on the skills required to
                become a game and simulation programmer. They consist of theory and hands on learning, including but not
                limited to: Programming, Networking, Art, Physics, and 3D modeling. My goal with this college is to start
                my own game development company with some good games under my belt.
